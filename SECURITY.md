# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is an Electron desktop application. Security fixes are provided on a best-effort basis for:

- The **latest release**
- The current **default branch**

Older releases are not guaranteed to receive security backports.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security reports.

Instead, use GitHub's **"Report a vulnerability"** feature (Security Advisories) so we can coordinate a private fix and responsible disclosure.

If you must include sensitive information (tokens, OAuth client details, logs), redact them first.
